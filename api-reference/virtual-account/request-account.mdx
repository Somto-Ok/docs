This API allows you to request a virtual account for either an individual or a corporate entity. The request body structure is determined by the `accountType` field.

### Request Body

- For an **individual** account:
  - `accountType`: `"individual"`

- For a **corporate** account:
  - `accountType`: `"corporate"`
